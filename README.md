bluej3270's Idea-
Genre - Exploration RPG
View- Top Down

    The player lives in a small farming village which has been taken over by halloween themed monsters who are attacking the village. The player is instructed to run for help in the
    nearby big city by his parrents. After sneeking out the back of the house and to the highway the player walks to the big city. In the big city the player finds everyone there is
    sad and boring. No one will belive him, dismising everything he says as a product of the childs imagination. When the child returns home he finds everyone dead. The child grows
    angry and attempts to bring the monsters to the large city. In the end he does this by discovering and defeting the leader of the monsters. However, the final battle is an
    internal one in which the child must decide between what is right, befrending the monsters and reclaiming his town, represented by the player, and listening to his feelings of
    anger at the city for not helping, represented by an alternative version of the player shown in an angry red color. Based on the outcome of this fight a cut scene will play
    showing the results of eather choice. If the child does what is right he is rewarded by finding his parrents in the wrecked village. If folows his feelings, he is rewarded by
    seeing the city buned, but at the loss of his home, burning down with his parrents still inside.
